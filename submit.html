            id="styles" href="format.zip">style file</a></font> </b> (updated on: Mar 27, 2016).


<h3>Submission Site</h3>

<p>The submission site is <a href="https://cmt.research.microsoft.com/AISTATS2016/">
    https://cmt.research.microsoft.com/AISTATS2016/</a>. </p>


<p>The deadline for uploading the final version of your paper is <b>Apr 18, 2016</b>.</p>

<p>To prepare your final paper, please change the string<br>
<code>\usepackage{aistats2016}</code><br>
to<br>
<code>\usepackage[accepted]{aistats2016}</code><br>
in you LaTeX source file.  Please do not modify the layout given by the style
file. If you have questions about the style file or its usage, please
contact the publications chair, <a href="http://alquier.ensae.net/">Pierre Alquier</a>.</p>

<p>
In the CMT <a
href="https://cmt.research.microsoft.com/AISTATS2016/Protected/Author/">Author
Console</a>, there is now a new column labeled &ldquo;Camera
Ready,&rdquo; and in this column, for each accepted paper, a link
labeled &ldquo;Edit.&rdquo; Use this link to submit camera-ready papers.
The CMT form will ask you for
the list of authors, the title, the abstract, and the following files
(where 642 is to be replaced by your paper ID):

<pre>
642.pdf
642-supp.xxx    (optional)
</pre>

If a supplementary file is included, its type xxx can be pdf, zip, tgz
or gz. In addition, you will be asked to provide submission code obtained
by an automated style checker and confirm that you agree with having
your work published in the proceedings.
</p>

<ol>
<li> Please ensure that the submitted title and abstract match the
ones in the camera-ready version, and do not include any LaTeX commands or
other non-human-readable markup.</li>

<li> Please ensure that the submitted list of authors and the ordering
among them matches the camera-ready version.</li>

<li> Please make sure any supplementary material is submitted as a
separate file and not appended to the main paper.</li>

<li> In preparing the camera-ready version, we request that you take
into account reviewer and meta-reviewer feedback.
Your camera-ready submission should be named 642.pdf (with 642
replaced by your paper ID).  We only accept pdf
files.  Please ensure that your camera-ready submission contains
author information (instead of &ldquo;Anonymous Author N&rdquo; as
was required for the original submission), and that you use the
standard style as provided above.
See detailed instructions for preparing the camera-ready paper in
Section 3 of the file sample_paper.pdf, included with the style files.</li>

<li> Please verify that your paper follows the style requirements by
submitting your pdf file to the
<a 
href="http://machinelearning.wustl.edu/pub/AISTATS2016/">
style checking script</a>. You will need to provide the paper ID,
your name (just one author), your e-mail and the pdf file. If the paper passes
the style checks, you will obtain a submission code. (Please
ignore the warnings of the style checker.) The CMT form
will ask you to provide this submission code.</li>

<li> The final version will appear in the proceedings, published by JMLR
W&amp;CP. The CMT will ask you to agree to have your
work published by JMLR according to the agreement outlined
<a
href="http://jmlr.org/proceedings/jmlrPublicationForm.pdf">here</a>.
Please print this form, sign it and upload a scanned version as a supplementary file.</li>

<li> You may optionally submit supplementary material, e.g., detailed
proofs, code, data, or slides.  Please submit these as
642-supp.xxx (with 642 replaced by your paper ID and xxx
replaced by the file type).
If the supplementary material includes multiple files, please
compress these into a single zip, tgz or gz file.</li>

<li> You may continue to edit your camera-ready
submissions until the camera-ready deadline.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Initial version submission instructions</h1>

<h3>Submission Site</h3>
The submission site is <a href="https://cmt.research.microsoft.com/AISTATS2016/">
    https://cmt.research.microsoft.com/AISTATS2016/</a>.

<h3>Formatting and Supplementary Material</h3>

<p>Submissions are limited to 8 pages <em>excluding</em> references using the
LaTeX style file we provide below. The number of pages containing citations
alone is not limited. You can also submit a single file of additional
supplementary material which may be either a pdf file (such as proof details)
or a zip file for other formats/more files (such as code or videos). Note that
reviewers are under no obligation to examine your supplementary material. If
you have only one supplementary pdf file, please upload it as is; otherwise
gather everything to the single zip file.  </p>

<p>Formatting information (including LaTeX style files) is <a
href="format.zip">here</a>. We do not support submission in preparation systems
other than LaTeX. Please do not modify the layout given by the style file. If
you have questions about the style file or its usage, please contact the
publications chair.</p>

<h3>Anonymization Requirements</h3>


<p>The AISTATS review process is double-blind. Please remove all identifying
information from your submission, including author names, affiliations, and any
acknowledgments. Self-citations can present a special problem: we recommend
leaving in a moderate number of self-citations for published or otherwise
well-known work. For unpublished or less-well-known work, or for large numbers
of self-citations, it is up to the author's discretion how best to preserve
anonymity. Possibilities include leaving out a citation altogether, including
it but replacing the citation text with "removed for anonymous submission," or
leaving the citation as-is; authors should choose for each citation the
treatment which is least likely to reveal authorship.</p>

<p>Previous tech-report or workshop versions of a paper can similarly present a
problem for anonymization. We suggest <em>leaving out</em> any identifying information
for such versions, but bringing them to the attention of the program committee
via the submission page. Reviewers will be instructed that tech reports
(including reports on sites such as <a href="http://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a>) and papers in workshops without
archival proceedings do not count as prior publication.</p>

<p>Reviewers may request code and accompanying data as part of the review
process. In this case, the authors will be asked to provide this material when
they receive their initial reviews, to be submitted at the end of the author
response period, in anonymized form (we understand that it might be difficult
to remove all traces of the authors from the files, and will not penalize
innocent mistakes).  The conference chairs will facilitate the anonymous
transfer of code to reviewers. Code and data will only be requested in the
event that this is the deciding factor in paper acceptance.  Further, the
request should be reasonable in light of the duration of the discussion period,
which limits the time available for review.  The SPC member in charge of the
paper will confirm whether a code request is warranted and reasonable.</p>


<h3>Previous or Concurrent Submissions</h3>

<p>Submitted manuscripts should not have been previously published in a journal
or in the proceedings of a conference, and should not be under consideration
for publication at another conference at any point during the AISTATS review
process. It is acceptable to have a substantially extended version of the
submitted paper under consideration simultaneously for journal publication, so
long as the journal version's planned publication date is in June 2016 or
later, the journal submission does not interfere with AISTATS's right to
publish the paper, and the situation is clearly described at the time of
AISTATS submission. Please describe the situation in the appropriate box on the
submission page (and do not include author information in the submission
itself, to avoid accidental unblinding).</p>

<p>As mentioned above, reviewers will be instructed that tech reports
(including reports on sites such as <a
href="http://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a>) and papers in workshops without
archival proceedings do not count as prior publication.</p>


<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

<p><b>Can I use BibTeX? Is there a BibTeX style file?</b></p>

<p>You can certainly use BibTeX. As the formatting instructions say, "Any
choice of citation style is acceptable as long as you are consistent." For
example abbrvnat style file should be good for most purposes.</p>
